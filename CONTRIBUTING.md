## ðŸ“Œ Setting up Locale Environment

### ðŸš© Forking repository :

1. Firstly you have to make your own copy of project. For that you have to fork the repository. You can find the fork button on the top-right side of the browser window. (Refer image below )
2. Kindly wait till it gets forked.
3. After that copy will look like `<your-user-name>/Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms-Assignments` forked from `karthikshetty03/DAA-Assignments`.

### ðŸš© Clone repository :

1. Now you have your own copy of project. Here you have to start your work.
2. Go to desired location on your computer where you want to set-up the project.
3. Right click there and click on `git bash`. A terminal window will pop up
4. Type the command `git clone <your-fork-url>.git` and hit enter.(Refer the image to copy url)
5. Wait for few seconds till the project gets copied

### ðŸš© Setting up remote :

1. Now you have to set up remote repositories
2. Type `git remote -v` in terminal to list remote connections to your repo.
3. It will show something like this:

```console

origin  https://github.com/<your-user-name>/Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms-Assignments (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/<your-user-name>/Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms-Assignments (push)

```

4. Now type the command `git remote add upstream https://github.com/karthikshetty03/Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms-Assignments` this will set upstream as main directory
5. Again type in command `git remote -v` to check if remote has been set up correctly
6. It should show something like this :

```console

origin  https://github.com/<your-user-name>/Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms-Assignments (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/<your-user-name>/Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms-Assignments (push)
upstream        https://github.com/karthikshetty03/Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms-Assignments (fetch)
upstream        https://github.com/karthikshetty03/Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms-Assignments (push)

```

### ðŸš© Creating a branch :

Whenever you want to contribute to any project. It is best practice that you should create a branch and push the branch as PR rather than directly pushing main/master branch

1. `git branch` will list all the branches in the repository
2. Now type `git branch <your-branch-name>` to create your branch
3. You can check the created branch by `git branch`
4. But still if you start editing the edits will go to the main branch. To change the path , type in `git checkout <your-branch-name>`
5. Now you are ready to do the desired changes.

By this time you can see a message on your github fork as `your fork is ahead of codeforcause:master by <number> of commits` and you can also see a button `Compare and pull request`.

1. Click on `Compare and pull request` 
2. Describe the changes and Click on `Pull request`
